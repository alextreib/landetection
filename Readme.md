# Lanedetection
This project reads the existing calibration through the calibration tool.
With this, it distorts the image and converts it into a bird-eye's view.
These images are basis for the lanedetection.

## Annotation
A better version is realized in the self-car driving car nanodegree program.
See the CarND-P1 project.
